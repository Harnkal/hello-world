# hello-world
I'm trying to learn how to use this tool so I'm creating this repository as suggested in the guide.

Well I've started working with database management in 2012, and that's when I started developing interest about the data science subject, now I just started a data science course at coursera and they presented me to this incredible tool!

now I'm adding this line directly to the master from my worplace, let's see if it works

I'm not sure of what I'm doing, but I think I'm add this line to a new branch
